<h2><em>Video Installation 2023</em></h2>
<h3>Handmade video cables, handmade video adapters, stack of books, projector, video convertors</h3>
<p>Solo exhibition Digging at Tata bookshop. A modular playground for signal I put together in a little book store attic. Includes 6 handmade adapters, handmade cables, a piece of wire that runs through stack of books, and a flask dripping water onto the books. The adapters say “thank you for this beautiful picture” in Japanese. My mom used to write on the jars she’d pickle plums in something like “thank you for becoming delicious :)”</p>
