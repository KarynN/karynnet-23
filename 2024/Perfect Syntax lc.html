	<h3>An installation of a point cloud of word embeddings projected to fit in the pulping chamber of an old paper mill in Holyoke MA. The points are made out of pieces of paper and thread and a single line of solder runs through the ‘Perfect Syntax.’</h3>

	<h2>ABOUT: </h2>
	<p>Perfect Syntax (an earlier video work) begins with a sequence of 144 words that is then rearranged in different permutations over the course of 8 minutes. This work explores the relationship of those words and the process of putting them together, in a space outside of the video.</p>	
	<br>

	<h2>TECHNICAL INFO: </h2>
	<p>Using the CLIP embeddings of those words (768 dimension representations of words which are used by image generation models like DALLE), I generated a T-SNE plot of the relationship of the words  in 3D space. I then wrote a loss function to preserve the shape of this point cloud, but fit it into the shape of an old paper mill pulping chamber that I made a 3D scan of. The ratios of the loss function were tweaked until the shape was “optimized”.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Then a singular sequence of those 144 words was generated using GPT, via calculating the highest probability next word starting with the same first word as the video (‘So’) and with accumulating context.	</p>
	<br>
	<p>The point cloud was created physically in the chamber out of pieces of paper and thread. A single line of solder runs through each word in the sequence generated by GPT.	</p>
