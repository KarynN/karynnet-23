	<h2>ABOUT: </h2>
		<p>A two channel video displayed through a custom two channel VGA cable - the ‘device for deterritorialization’ which takes two inputs and swaps 3 wires lines within the VGA, causing the video that is displayed on each monitor to be a mix of the two inputs. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The inputs themselves are two channels of text narrating a scene of two people crossing a street from opposite sides from each of their perspectives with one in Japanese and one in English. The two characters are a girl skipping to the park with bottles of pink lemonade in hand, and the other a man carrying suitcases to the bus station headed on a trip home. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The first half of the story is narrated in second person, with the girl’s in Japanese on the left, and the man’s in English on the right. At the center of the crosswalk, the two exchange a glance, at which point, they become aware of each other. The rest of the story of the two as they finish crossing the street are described from each other’s perspectives, speculating on each other’s lives. The girl’s story now told in English on the right, as a hypothetical story of the man’s, and the man’s story now in Japanese on the left, as a hypothetical story put together from the girl’s perspective. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Each of the two input videos are supposed to display one line of text in one language in the center scrolling horizontally to the left. The mixing of the signals evident in the overlapping of the two different languages of text with the ‘foreign’ signal displaced vertically and scanning horizontally, is entirely due to this device and the desynchronization it causes with the timing established between the domain signal and hardware. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Two original VGA cables Frankensteined with their individual wires exposed, run vertically, lining the sides of the device. The individual wires cross over the center to mix between each other, with the help of custom extension cables that form into the words ‘AND’ and ‘SO’. The space in between the two cables is decorated with text cut into lines, wire, a netting made of solder wire and strung from it, slices of an image of tree branches, a piece of paper instructing how to write a part of a kanji, ripped fabric of characters, fibers from a piece of cloth, a glossy postcard of a digital screenshot of a face with the text ‘START’, and a tiny screen that endlessly tries to weave together grids of Japanese and English text. Fragments images, languages, and the materials they are made of are woven together into a functional tapestry hung from the wall between the monitors that display its effects on the ephemeral signal that flows through it. </p>
