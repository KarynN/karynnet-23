<h2><em>Print 2022</em></h2>
<h3>50 postcards</h3>
<p>I printed the same thing on the same piece of paper over and over.  Apparently if you try to make a Canon TS 6030 print on smaller pieces of paper than itâ€™s supposed to, it kinda misses the center and spits it out at a semi random slant and position depending on however the paper lifting mechanism happens + how well I center the paper when I throw it in the tray.  I love that.  Variation.  So cool.  Absolutely adorable when machines act up like they're warm and alive.  Forget that I spend 339048 hours of my day complaining about technology not working and being unreliable.</p>
<p>50 variations of grids, lines, shapes, and words.</p>
