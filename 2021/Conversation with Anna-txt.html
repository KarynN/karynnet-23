<h1 id="conversation-with-anna">Conversation with Anna</h1>
<h2><em>Audio 2021</em></h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>In this audio piece, the left channel is a conversation I had with my friend Anna one day and the right channel is the noise of a 3D printer that is drawing a visualization of our conversation. The visualization is the path traced by a dot that moves around the canvas as my voice adds horizontal velocity and Anna's voice adds vertical velocity to the dot. </p>
<p>My conversation with Anna was 8 minutes. The 3D printer takes 8 minutes to complete the drawing. Through the creation of a physical visualization, my conversation with Anna is translated from our voices into the shrieks and beeps of the machine. </p>
