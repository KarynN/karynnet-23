	<p style = "margin: 10px;">In 1995, net artist duo JODI created Automatic Rain - a web piece in which columns of numbers trickled downwards, filling the page.  This motion that resembled rain falling was not a calculated animation, but created purely due to the slow loading time of the 1995 web and the nature of how web pages load from top to down.  The now extinct blink tag was also used to rerun the animation over and over.</p>
	<p style = "margin: 10px;">I decided to recreate this piece to work in 2021.  Like the original page, the animation is purely driven by loading speed, except I artificially simulated the 1995 web load speed by filling my html file with a ton of junk.  The only timed animation is clearing the page and reloading it. Because the rain depends entirely on web load speed and your browser cache situation, you may get a little drizzle or a typhoon.</p>
