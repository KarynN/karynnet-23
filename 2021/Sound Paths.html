		<h1>Sound Paths</h1>
		<h2>Fall 2021</h2>
		<h3>A series of experiments visualizing piano notes as paths of lines in 3D space and on surfaces of buildings through live interactive installations. </h3>

	<div class = "scroll">
		<h2>ABOUT: </h2>
		<p>Various iterations took place over the course of 3-4 months with some carving paths out in 2D space, some in 3D space, sometimes following each individual key, sometimes aggregating keys of the same note, and sometimes following distinct musical lines in a piece. I was invited to MAPP Montreal to present a version with 2 keyboards tracing out paths on a canvas for a 3 day festival.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Schoenberg Scribble - an audiovisual animation that traces the path of every note in my playing of Schoenberg’s Drei Klavierstücke in 3D space resulting in a scribble.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Binocular Bach - the two distinct lines in Bach’s Partita no.1 in B flat major Menuet 1 visualized as two lines moving in 3D space.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Sound as Network - Each line follows a note from C to B and grows as it is played, leaving behind a network of the piece. The song is Kapustin’s Etude no.3.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>TECHNICAL INFO: </h2>
		<p>Each different visualization is a custom program made in Touchdesigner that takes realtime MIDI input from the keyboard to generate the 2D paths or 3D geometries. The animation is then mapped to the projection that covers the wall and the floor to appear as if the lines emerge out of the MIDI keyboard on the ground.</p>
